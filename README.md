Welcome to my repository!
In it, you will find a code that implements the Canonical Genetic Algorithm for finding a straight line that best fits a series of observed points. This is part of a university assignment, so it is constrained to the problem setted. However, the algorithm can be implemented generally en different problems. 

**About me:** 

My name is Anna Maria Llopart, a university student from Biomedical Engineering in UPF. My Unis is U199965 and you can contact me through my university email annamaria.llopart01@estudiant.upf.edu

**About my project:**

What is it about?

Genetic Algorithms (GA) are an optimization technique based on the evolution and genetics. It aims to search the best solution through selection and reproduction, simulating the solutions in a genotype format. Concretely, this project is an application of the Canonical Genetic Algorithms (CGA), a type of GA proposed by John Holland in 1965. In CGA, the probability that genotypes in the current population are copied and placed in the intermediate generation is in proportion to their fitness. Their fitness are also the main responsibles for processes like mating, offering new solutions to the next generation. [1]

State of the art: 

Genetic Algorithms have been extensively studied. There are many types of GA apart from the CGA. All of them have been applied in different areas. For example, fields like machine learning, neural network designing, function optimization, have been incredibly developed thanks to the use of complex GA. 

Limitations: 

Limitations of the GA include: limited focus on control flow coverage, use of simple genetic operators, lack of consideration of certain types of data and multiple procedures, manual selection of paths to be covered, random population selection initial and need for stronger fitness functions. These limitations may affect the effectiveness and efficiency of generating test data using Genetic Algorithms.[2]

My code: 

This code is the resolution of a university assignment. Therefore, it was not intended to improve these limitations, just to apply the CGA in a specific problem. 
To run this, you will need to download the Jupyter Notebook software or you can either use Colaboratory from Google.
